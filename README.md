JavaScript Exercises - The Hacking Project

This repository contains a series of JavaScript exercises completed during the The Hacking Project bootcamp. The goal was to practice core JS concepts including loops, data manipulation, array methods, and basic conditional logic.
🚀 Projects Overview

Each script corresponds to a specific exercise:

    script_1.js: Basic user interaction using prompt() to display a personalized greeting in the console.

    script_2.js: A factorial calculator using a loop to process user-input numbers.

    script_3.js: A "Mario Pyramid" generator that prints a right-aligned staircase based on a chosen number of floors.

    script_4.js: Data analysis on an array of famous entrepreneurs (filtering by birth year, mapping names, and alphabetical sorting).

    script_5.js: Library management simulation using array methods like .find(), .filter(), and .reduce() to find the most/least rented books.

    script_6.js: Genetic code translator that converts mRNA sequences (codons) into protein chains (amino acids).

    script_7.js: A sarcastic "Teenager Chat-bot" with specific conditional logic priorities.

🛠️ How to run

    Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

    Open the index.html file in your preferred browser.

    Open the Developer Console (F12 or Cmd + Opt + J) to see the results.

    To test a specific script, simply change the <script src="..."> tag in the index.html file.

🧠 Key Concepts Learned

    Loops: for, while.

    Data Structures: Working with Arrays of Objects.

    Array Methods: .filter(), .map(), .sort(), .reduce(), .every(), .find().

    Strings: Manipulation with .trim(), .toUpperCase(), .includes(), and RegEx.
